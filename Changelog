v0.0.8:
    -Improved "Does a tool cut reads?" plot;
    -Added "Does error-correction perturb the number of reads mapping to the genes and transcripts?" plots;
    -Reordered some of the stats in the tables, so that they are in according to the plots;
    -Added Appendix plots on Paralogous families
    -Paralogous genes families taken into account in their respective plots now need cardinality 2+;
    -Small fixes to the html template;
    -Fixed small visual bug on small screens

v0.0.7:
    -Added a warning on the error stats plot regarding the sampling;
    -Added a normalized "Lost transcripts in genes with Splicing Complexity 2+" plot;
    -Some refactoring and bug correction.

v0.0.6:
    -Added Annotation stats plots
    -Difference on the number of isoforms of a gene before and after correction now considers only genes expressed in BOTH the raw reads AND the tool
    -Added Gene-family scale Difference on the number of isoforms of a gene before and after correction plot
    -Added html anchors
    -Added loading animation
    -Created a support web page (for now contains only the v0.06 small report): http://leoisl.gitlab.io/LR_EC_analyser_support/
    -Fixed some bugs


v0.0.5:
    -Plots are more interactive: now we can click on the bar of some plots and retrieve list of gene families/genes/transcripts
    -Hybrid EC now come always before Self EC
    -Adding back trans_chimera and self_chimera plots, and explanations to some features
    -Errors are now reported in % over the total # of bases
    -Improved main tables presentation
    -Solved some bugs
