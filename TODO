TODO:
    -Add a plot with the nb of genes detected before and after correction

High Priority:
    -Finish paper, then check the rest

    -How does error correction affects read quantification
        -True quantification is given by Illumina
            -Then we always need the Illumina data, which might not be available.
            -In this case, true quantification is given by raw long reads?
        -Or should we simply receive a file with <transcript> <quant> and assume it as the quantification?
            -Like this, the user can use any method he/she relies for quantification.
        -Get the scatter plot and r^2 for raw x Illumina, and each tool x Illumina

    -I guess the main problem for error correcting are repeats.
        -In DNA, repeats appear in form of repeats themselves.
        -Repeats in RNA differ from DNA
            -We do have expressed repeats, but AS/paralogy can cause similar problems (similar sequences expressed)
            -Explore the quality of reads in this regard
            -Basically we want to answer:
                -Does a tool get affect by high repeat content?
                -Does a tool get affect by high AS?
                -Does a tool get affect by high paralogy?
                -Do a boxplot with the avg score of all genes in a given category to check this?


    -Focus on the new reads that are produced by the error correctors

    -Fix  gene track not showing

    -Make all plots interactive
        -When clicking on a bar or on a point, open an IGV plot showing the alignment of the reads to the concerned gene/transcript



Normal:
    -Main tables presentation:
        -Coloring, ranking and percentage filter


    -Checking if the file server is online/verifying the file server
        -When finishing the output, but a 5kb long string in a javascript file - this will be the id of the run
        -Put the id also in the final html page (hard-coded)
        -In the index page, in the Gene and transcript table, check if the server is alive. If not, show a warning saying that IGV won't work
        -If the server is alive, ask for the id. The id must match the on in the index html, otherwise issue an error
        -If everything is fine, show a message
        -Have a small form with an input for a port and a button "Retry" that checks if the server is fine



Low priority:
    -Paralogous
        -How to really get families of paralogous genes???
            -Is the method I am doing correctly?

    -Think about new plots:
        -Quantif correlation between the raw and error correction tools?
            -Like what Camille does with the quantif of Nanopore vs Illumina
