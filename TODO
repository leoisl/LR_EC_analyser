High Priority:
    -Focus on the new reads that are produced by the error correctors

    -Work on the text

    -Fix  gene track not showing

    -Add all plots from the paper
        -Low-priority possible stuff (for the paper, L): isolate the part of AlignQC that plots the read length histogram, make it plot with consistent y axis.

    -Make all plots interactive
        -When clicking on a bar or on a point, open an IGV plot showing the alignment of the reads to the concerned gene/transcript



Normal:
    -Main tables presentation:
        -Coloring, ranking and percentage filter


    -Checking if the file server is online/verifying the file server
        -When finishing the output, but a 5kb long string in a javascript file - this will be the id of the run
        -Put the id also in the final html page (hard-coded)
        -In the index page, in the Gene and transcript table, check if the server is alive. If not, show a warning saying that IGV won't work
        -If the server is alive, ask for the id. The id must match the on in the index html, otherwise issue an error
        -If everything is fine, show a message
        -Have a small form with an input for a port and a button "Retry" that checks if the server is fine



Low priority:
    -Paralogous
        -How to really get families of paralogous genes???
            -Is the method I am doing correctly?

    -Think about new plots:
        -Quantif correlation between the raw and error correction tools?
            -Like what Camille does with the quantif of Nanopore vs Illumina
