IGV performance:
    -For IGV, better convert gtf -> bed and index the bed (or ask for a bed, or use the gtf without being indexed)
        or index the gtf directly (did not find how to do this)
    -Work on IGV page
        -Zoom in to see features is not nice

Presentation:
    -Coloring, ranking and percentage filter
