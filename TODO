Priority:
    IGV:
        -Zoom in to see features is not nice
            -I guess we can work with visibilityWindow (see https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/wiki/Tracks-1.0)
            -It should be set to the length of the gene/transcript
    -Add all plots from the paper




Normal:
    -Checking if the file server is online/verifying the file server
        -When finishing the output, but a 5kb long string in a javascript file - this will be the id of the run
        -Put the id also in the final html page (hard-coded)
        -In the index page, in the Gene and transcript table, check if the server is alive. If not, show a warning saying that IGV won't work
        -If the server is alive, ask for the id. The id must match the on in the index html, otherwise issue an error
        -If everything is fine, show a message
        -Have a small form with an input for a port and a button "Retry" that checks if the server is fine

    -Presentation:
        -Coloring, ranking and percentage filter

    -Think about new plots:
        -Quantif correlation between the raw and error correction tools?
            -Like what Camille does with the quantif of Nanopore vs Illumina





Low priority:
    -Paralogous
        -How to really get families of paralogous genes???
            -Is the method I am doing correctly?
