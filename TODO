-Quantif correlation between the raw and error correction tools?
    -Like what Camille does with the quantif of Nanopore vs Illumina

-Paralogous
    -How to really get families of paralogous genes???
        -Is the method I am doing correctly?

-Error reporting
    -When finishing the output, but a 5kb long string in a javascript file - this will be the id of the run
    -Put the id also in the final html page (hard-coded)
    -In the index page, in the Gene and transcript table, check if the server is alive. If not, show a warning saying that IGV won't work
    -If the server is alive, ask for the id. The id must match the on in the index html, otherwise issue an error
    -If everything is fine, show a message
    -Have a small form with an input for a port and a button "Retry" that checks if the server is fine


IGV performance:
    -For IGV, better convert gtf -> bed and index the bed (or ask for a bed, or use the gtf without being indexed)
        or index the gtf directly (did not find how to do this)
    -Work on IGV page
        -Zoom in to see features is not nice


Presentation:
    -Coloring, ranking and percentage filter

ENSMUSG00000025200 in the sample data gives an error because the bam files in some tools are empty
    Check it to not give errors anymore
